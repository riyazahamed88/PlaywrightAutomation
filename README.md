# Playwright Installation and Setup Guide

## What is Node.js?

Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform, backend JavaScript runtime environment that runs on the V8 engine and executes JavaScript code outside of a web browser.

## Install Node.js

### For Windows:

1. **Download Node.js:**
   - Visit the [Node.js official website](https://nodejs.org).
   - Choose the LTS (Long Term Support) version for stability.

2. **Run the Installer:**
   - Open the downloaded `.msi` installer file.
   - Follow the installation prompts. Ensure to check the box for "Automatically install the necessary tools" if prompted.

3. **Verify the Installation:**
   - Open Command Prompt and check the Node.js version:
     ```bash
     node -v
     ```
   - Check the npm (Node Package Manager) version:
     ```bash
     npm -v
     ```

### For macOS:

1. **Using Homebrew:**
   - If Homebrew is installed, run the following command:
     ```bash
     brew install node
     ```

2. **Download from the Official Website:**
   - Alternatively, download the macOS `.pkg` installer from the [Node.js website](https://nodejs.org) and follow the prompts.

3. **Verify the Installation:**
   - Open Terminal and check the Node.js version:
     ```bash
     node -v
     ```
   - Check the npm version:
     ```bash
     npm -v
     ```

### For Linux (Ubuntu/Debian-based):

1. **Using the NodeSource Repository:**
   - Open Terminal and run the following commands to add the NodeSource repository and install Node.js:
     ```bash
     curl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_lts.x | sudo -E bash -
     sudo apt-get install -y nodejs
     ```

2. **Verify the Installation:**
   - Check the Node.js version:
     ```bash
     node -v
     ```
   - Check the npm version:
     ```bash
     npm -v
     ```

## Post-Installation

After installing Node.js, use npm (Node Package Manager) to install additional packages or tools, such as `newman` or `express`.

## Install Visual Studio Code

Download and install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) for editing and running your Playwright tests.

## Playwright Installation

### Official Site

Visit the [Playwright official site](https://playwright.dev/) for detailed documentation and examples.

### Setup Instructions

1. **Create a New Project Folder:**
   - Create a folder on your local machine, e.g., `Playwright Automation`.
   - Open Visual Studio Code and select this folder.

2. **Installing Playwright:**
   - Initialize Playwright in your project by running:
     ```bash
     npm init playwright@latest
     ```
   - Follow the installation prompts:
     - Choose between TypeScript or JavaScript (default is TypeScript).
     - Specify the name of your tests folder (default is `tests` or `e2e`).
     - Optionally, add a GitHub Actions workflow for CI.
     - Install Playwright browsers (default is true).

### What’s Installed

- **Browsers:** Playwright downloads the necessary browsers.
- **Configuration and Test Files:**
  - `playwright.config.ts`
  - `package.json`
  - `package-lock.json`
  - `tests/` (contains `example.spec.ts`)
  - `tests-examples/` (contains `demo-todo-app.spec.ts`)

The `playwright.config.ts` file is where you configure Playwright, including modifying which browsers to use. If you’re integrating Playwright into an existing project, dependencies will be added directly to your `package.json`.

### Run a Sample Test

1. **Modify the Test Code:**
   - Update the `example.spec.js` file with your test code.

2. **Run the Test:**
   - In the terminal, execute:
     ```bash
     npx playwright test example.spec.js
     ```
   - Playwright will launch a browser, run the test, and display the results in the terminal.

3. **Open the Last HTML Report:**
   - To view the last test report in HTML format, run:
     ```bash
     npx playwright show-report
     ```
